The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data cannot be provided . Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount and feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
